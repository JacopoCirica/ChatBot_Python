# ChatBot_Python
AI ChatBot using Python Tensorflow and Natural Language Processing (NLP) along side TFLearn

We are going to Build a Chatbot that Understands the Context of Sentense and Respond accordingly.
These are the Things that we are going to do in this Project -
1. Transforming the Conversational Intents into Tensorflow model (Neural Network using TFLEARN) using NLP and Save it as Pickle also.
2. Load the Same Pickle and Model to Build the Framework to Process the Responses.
3. At Last, We Show How the Inputs are Processed and Give the Reponses.

#### TFLEARN  - TFlearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow. It was designed to provide a higher-level API to TensorFlow in order to facilitate and speed-up experimentations, while remaining fully transparent and compatible with it.  (http://tflearn.org/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### TENSORFLOW - TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
